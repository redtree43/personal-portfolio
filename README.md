# <a id="top"></a> My Personal Portfolio Project
## www.rowdyrich.netlify.com

My personal portfolio is a snapshot into my design sense and coding skills. The portfolio should not be a comprehensive view of everything I have to offer, but should show different avenues an interested party could pursue in discussion with me.

For my design I went with a barebones structures using a combination of colours inspired by afro-futuristic science fiction designs. I have been heavily influenced by comic book art with an emphasis on the strong lines and bright colours used in Image & Marvel comics in the late 2000's.

# <a id="MoodBoard"></a>Mood Board
My Pintrest mood board is made up of images that I dound through looking up Afro-Futurism and then recommendations made by Pintrest based on my saved images.

# <a id="MVP"></a>Minimum Viable Product
My MVP is a basic website using the Afro-Futurism colour scheme. It is designed to be a supplement for my CV so that employers can find me and easily contact me. In the future I will likely do a full rework to be structured around some saucy.

## Tagline
My tagline is "I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.” which is a quote by Thomas Jefferson. I also considered "Take time to deliberate; but when the time for action arrives, stop thinking and go in." I wanted to include a quote that was based around being a good worker so that employers will think I'm a dedicated employee. And Thomas Jefferson is someone everyone knows who has associations with excellence and achievement.

## Ian Enders
My primary inspiration for my website was the personal portfolio of Ian Enders. It is a simple, one page design that really catches the eye when you see it. It uses limited content to have more impact with the content available.

## Typography
My Typography was randomly selected from Google fonts on a whim. I wanted a font that was modern and simple.

# <a id="Wireframes"></a>Style Guide and Wireframes
I used Figma to do my design and finalise my layout.

# <a id="Challenges"></a>Challenges
My biggest challenge was deciding on a layout. I found that finding inspirations for my design was more difficult than actually figuring stuff out in CSS due to the simplicity of my design. I originally had grandiose plans for how my site would look without the technical skills to back it up. 

My original design was going to be heavily reliant on photography which I was unable to take. This was what contributed to my decision to further strip down my design.

One particular challenge was when I tried to do a bottom border line, I accidentally put the attribute values in the wrong order. I figured it out in the end though.

# <a id="Well"></a> What Went Well
My colour choices and font selection was done quickly and is easy to see on the screen while still being soft on the eyes.

# <a id="WhereFromHere"></a>Where To From Here
The site that inspired me the most was ianenders.com and in the future I want to take some good photos of myself and do something like this. I envision my portfolio being primarily about showcasing a bit of my character through the use of photography/writing and my github to be used for seeing my technical abilities.

# <a id="Coding"></a>Coding
I started coding from the top down based on my design. I did the name and logo first, then the About/Work/Skills, then the form and finally, the icons.  My site is exclusively HTML & CSS.
